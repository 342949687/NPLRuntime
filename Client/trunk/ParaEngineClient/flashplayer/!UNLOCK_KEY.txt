Your unlock key is 6780fbf3-ee96-4ffe-9e6f-14b2b13afb9b

This key is only for you, don't redistribute it!

To protect the full version, you should use unlock key. The unlock key removes "DEMO VERSION" from the 
center of a f-in-box window.

After creating a f-in-box window, set the unlock key for the window:

[ VC++ ]

HWND hwnd_FPC = FPC_CreateWindow(...);

FPC_SetContext(hwnd_FPC, "6780fbf3-ee96-4ffe-9e6f-14b2b13afb9b");


[ VB6 ]

Private Declare Sub FPC_SetContext Lib "f_in_box.dll" _
    (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal Context As String)
